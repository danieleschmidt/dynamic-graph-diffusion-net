## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, report security vulnerabilities by:

1. **Email**: Send details to [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com)
2. **GitHub Security**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Encrypted Communication**: Use our PGP key for sensitive information

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution Timeline**: Varies based on severity and complexity

### Security Measures

This project implements several security best practices:

#### Dependency Security
- Regular dependency updates
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Dependency pinning for reproducible builds

#### Code Security
- Static analysis tools (Ruff, MyPy)
- Pre-commit hooks for security checks
- Regular security-focused code reviews

#### Infrastructure Security
- Secure CI/CD pipelines
- Minimal dependencies principle
- Regular security audits

### Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Investigation**: We investigate and confirm the vulnerability
2. **Development**: We develop and test a fix
3. **Coordination**: We coordinate with the reporter on disclosure timing
4. **Release**: We release the fix and publish a security advisory
5. **Recognition**: We acknowledge the reporter (if desired)

### Security Best Practices for Users

When using this library:

#### Installation Security
```bash
# Verify package integrity
pip install dynamic-graph-diffusion-net --force-reinstall --no-deps
pip check

# Use virtual environments
python -m venv dgdn-env
source dgdn-env/bin/activate
```

#### Data Security
```python
# Sanitize input data
import torch

def sanitize_graph_data(edge_index, edge_attr):
    """Validate and sanitize graph inputs."""
    assert isinstance(edge_index, torch.Tensor)
    assert edge_index.dtype == torch.long
    assert edge_index.min() >= 0
    return edge_index, edge_attr
```

#### Model Security
```python
# Validate model inputs
def safe_model_inference(model, data):
    """Safely run model inference with input validation."""
    # Validate input shapes and types
    # Implement resource limits
    # Handle potential exceptions
    pass
```

### Known Security Considerations

#### Model Security
- **Adversarial Attacks**: Graph neural networks can be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations
- **Model Extraction**: Protect trained models from unauthorized access
- **Data Poisoning**: Validate training data integrity

#### Privacy Considerations
- **Graph Privacy**: Be aware of privacy implications when working with graph data
- **Differential Privacy**: Consider implementing differential privacy for sensitive datasets
