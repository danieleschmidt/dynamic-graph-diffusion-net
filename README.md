# dynamic-graph-diffusion-net
dynamic-graph-diffusion-net implements the groundbreaking Dynamic Graph Diffusion Network (DGDN) architecture from ICLR 2025's "Rationalizing &amp; Augmenting Dynamic GNNs" paper. This library addresses critical failure modes in static-to-dynamic graph learning through novel edge-time encoding and variational diffusion sampling techniques.
