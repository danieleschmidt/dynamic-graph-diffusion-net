## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges in Dynamic Graph Learning

1. **Limited Uncertainty Quantification**: Existing methods provide point estimates without confidence measures
2. **Poor Temporal Modeling**: Static GNNs struggle with evolving graph structures
3. **Information Bottlenecks**: Traditional message passing limits information flow
4. **Scalability Issues**: Computational complexity grows with temporal dependencies
5. **Lack of Interpretability**: Black-box models with limited explanation capabilities

### Market Gap

Current solutions (DyRep, JODIE, TGN) focus on deterministic embeddings and lack:
- Principled uncertainty quantification
- Built-in explainability features
- Robust handling of noisy temporal data
- Efficient scaling to large graphs
